RA code for 2018 using py wrapper for rtlsdr, plus octave 

In this version the python script rtl_proc.py captures samples
from the RTL dongle, computes PSDs then writes the results to file.
It first reads the parameter values from rtlpars.txt
Start this routine with 'python rtl_proc.py'

Output files are psd1.txt and psd2.txt  These contain spectra (in dBs)
at Fc1 and Fc2, averaged using the Welch method. The py script will
wait until these files are deleted (by octave) before further sampling. 

At present, octave script rtl_disp.m can be used to read the PSDs and
display them (say on another machine) to test the front end is working.
Start this routine with "octave rtl_disp.m"  This script can also be
run on the same headless RPI - eg "ssh -Y ipaddress" will forward the
graphics output from the RPI to the PC from which ssh was started.  
Note that the octave script also requires access to the file rtlpars.txt.
